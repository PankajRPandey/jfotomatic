# About
JFotomatic is the first ever project developed by me from scratch. This was the academic project as part of the partial fulfillment of my B. Sc. [Computer Science] degree.

This project was developed using notepad and MS Word for graphics :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

I haven't followed any design pattern here. I have no plans to redesign this for now.


# Source code restructured for IntelliJ
My buddy Rakesh has tried his best to restructure this mess and the same can be found here -
